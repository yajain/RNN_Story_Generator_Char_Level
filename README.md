# RNN_Story_Generator_Char_Level

This piece of code uses PyTorch for training a character level RNN using LSTM to output a story in the style of the author Anna Karenina. It has been trained on text of 1985223 characters. It can take a starting character as input and output the subsequent characters in a way that the resultant bunch of characters will resemble a story written by Anna Karenina
